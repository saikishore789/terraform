You have created a new resource via Terraform.
Users have made a lot of manual changes (both infrastructure and inside the server)
Two ways to deal with this:  Import The Changes to Terraform / Delete & Recreate the resource.

Overview of Terraform Taint
The terraform taint command manually marks a Terraform-managed resource as tainted, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply.

procedure:
letâ€™s create ec2 instance 
letâ€™s  make resource s taint :
terraform taint aws_instance.myec2
make terraform plan
see the output
check state file ðŸ¡ª tainted in state file
the terraform apply

command
terraform taint aws_instance.myec2

Important Pointers for Terraform Taint
This command will not modify infrastructure but does modify the state file in order to mark a resource as tainted. 
Once a resource is marked as tainted, the next plan will show that the resource will be destroyed and recreated and the next apply will implement this change.
Note that tainting a resource for recreation may affect resources that depend on the newly tainted resource.
